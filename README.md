# LuaAndroidTest
Test project to reproduce differences in results of project anarchy scripting on Win32 and Android build

# Test Scene Expected Behavior
1. The scene should spawn 3 cubes in the middle of the scene every 1.0 seconds from a prefab.
1. The cube has a physics body and should move up a little then fall to the floor.
1. The cubes will be removed after they have been alive for 1.8 seconds

# Behavior on Android (Tested on x86 build)
Most of the time, less than 3 entities will appear spawn.
The longer the build is run for, the less entities will spawn.
It appears that they are spawning and being removed instantly.

# Behvior in vForge
As expected.

# Possible cause
Each entity defines a "self.age" value, if that value is nil then it sets it to zero and uses it to keep track of how long it has been alive.

It seems that the self.age value is not nil when a new object is created, possibly it has the value of a previous instance.

# Notable Files 
[SceneScript.lua](Assets/Scripts/SceneScript.lua) - spawns the cubes

[EntityScript.lua](Assets/Scripts/EntityScript.lua) - script for each entity that is spawned that handles removal of itself

# Other notes

This build contains no custom swig wrappers, or any custom C++ code. The project code was generated by PA 2014.1
